Right after their "orgy of mutual loathing," also known as the final presidential debate, Clinton and Trump attended the annual Al Smith Dinner in New York.  Unfortunately, neither was pleasant for the presidential nominees. 

"The event forced them almost as close together as Maria Bartiromo's show stealing ta-tas," joked "Full Frontal" host Samantha Bee. 

"Was it awkward, no, not at all," the host added before playing a clip of Trump accusing Hillary of pretending to hate Catholics and getting kicked off the Watergate Commission, for which he was booed by the Al Smith audience. 

"Trump shocked a Catholic cardinal, and cardinals have seen some sick sh*t," Bee pointed out.

Catholic hospitals have become the largest non-profit healthcare provider in the US, with 1 out of every 6 patients in the US being cared for by a Catholic hospital. SPONSORED
