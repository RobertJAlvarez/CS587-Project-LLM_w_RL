After Pitt Athletic Director Heather Lyke told the Canton Repository that Pitt was close to finalizing a contract offer to extend its series with Penn State past 2019, Nittany Lions Athletic Director Sandy Barbour responded to reports about the intrastate rivalry series. 

"As I’ve said many times before, I have strong appreciation for the history and tradition of the Penn State-Pitt series.  Since Heather’s arrival at Pitt we’ve had conversations about the series," Barbour said in an emailed statement to The Daily Collegian.  "We (Penn State) have to determine how any possible future games might fit with our other scheduling requirements and objectives. "

Barbour seemed to indicate the extension is probably in the works, but isn't too close to being finalized yet.  While Lyke could be right about Pitt finalizing a contract offer, it still would have to be accepted by Barbour and Penn State before the two teams can move forward with their series. 

There are two scheduled contests remaining between Penn State and Pitt (in Pittsburgh in 2018 and at Beaver Stadium in 2019) before the current series expires. The

There are two scheduled contests remaining between Penn State and Pitt (in Pittsburgh in 2018 and at Beaver Stadium in 2019) before the current series expires. The final of the two games will mark the 100th time the two programs will meet.

The Nittany Lions still have two non-conference games to schedule in 2020 and one to schedule in 2021. Should a new deal be inked before Penn State fills these slots, it's possible the two teams could meet for another home-and-home series.

However, with the emphasis the College Football Playoff selection committee places on strength of schedule, it may not be in Penn State's best interest to play Pitt every season, given it has only three non-conference games on its schedule. This is probably what Penn State and Barbour will be deciding should Lyke and Pitt send over a contract extension for the series.

Oliver Queen saved the day once again — this time as mayor. 

After a shooter targeted City Hall during Wednesday’s episode of Arrow, Oliver (Stephen Amell) needed to use his power as the mayor, not as the Green Arrow, to save his city.  Oliver was successful in pleading with the shooter, who had taken his anger out on Star City’s government for failing to pass a gun safety law after his family was killed in a shooting.  Ironic, yes, but will the shooter’s actions impact Oliver’s opinion on killing moving forward?

“One of the things you’ll see in the second half of season 5 is the gray area becomes a lot more gray,” executive producer Marc Guggenheim says.  “We’re really delving into the complexities of Oliver being a killer in a way that we’ve never done on the show before. ”

Oliver was successful in pleading with the shooter, who had taken his anger out on Star City’s government for failing to pass a gun safety law after his family was killed in a shooting.  Ironic, yes, but will the shooter’s actions impact Oliver’s opinion on killing moving forward?

“One of the things you’ll see in the second half of season 5 is the gray area becomes a lot more gray,” executive producer Marc Guggenheim says.  “We’re really delving into the complexities of Oliver being a killer in a way that we’ve never done on the show before. ”

Whereas past seasons have been very black-and-white when it comes to Oliver’s decision to kill his enemies — it’s been his modus operandi to take no prisoners for most of the series — this season will explore the reasons why. “In 1500 cubic
cap, and until we must succeed; if it fails, we shall admit the
19th of March, I took my post once more in the saloon. The electric log
told me that the speed of the _Nautilus_ had been slackened. It was
then going towards the surface; but prudently emptying its reservoirs
very slowly. My heart beat fast. Were we going to emerge and regain the
open polar atmosphere? No! A shock told me that the _Nautilus_ had
struck the bottom of the iceberg, still very thick, judging from the
deadened sound. We had in deed “struck,” to use a sea expression, but
in an inverse sense, and at a thousand feet deep. This would give three
thousand feet of ice above us; one thousand being above the water-mark.
The iceberg was then higher than at its borders—not a very reassuring
fact. Several times that day the _Nautilus_ tried again, and every time
it struck the wall which lay like a ceiling above it. Sometimes it met
with but 900 yards, only 200 of which rose above the surface. It was
twice the height it was when the _Nautilus_ had gone under the waves. I
carefully noted the different depths, and thus obtained a submarine
profile of the chain as it was developed under the water. That night no
change had taken place in our situation. Still ice between four and
five hundred yards in depth! It was evidently diminishing, but, still,
what a thickness between us and the surface of the ocean! It was then
eight. According to the daily custom on board the _Nautilus_, its air
should have been renewed four hours ago; but I did not suffer much,
although Captain Nemo had not yet made any demand upon his reserve of
oxygen. My sleep was painful that night; hope and fear besieged me by
turns: I rose several times. The groping of the _Nautilus_ continued.
About three in the morning, I noticed that the lower surface of the
iceberg was only about fifty feet deep. One hundred and fifty feet now
separated us from the surface of the waters. The iceberg was by degrees
becoming an ice-field, the mountain a plain. My eyes never left the
manometer. We were still rising diagonally to the surface, which
sparkled under the electric rays. The iceberg was stretching both above
and beneath into lengthening slopes; mile after mile it was getting
thinner. At length, at six in the morning of that memorable day, the
19th of March, the door of the saloon opened, and Captain Nemo
appeared.

fins of the sea, in different beds.
Under ordinary conditions these observations are made by means of
rather complicated instruments, and with somewhat doubtful results, by
means of thermometrical sounding-leads, the glasses often breaking
under the pressure of the water, or an apparatus grounded on the
variations of the resistance of metals to the electric currents.
Results so obtained could not be correctly calculated. On the contrary,
Captain Nemo went himself to test the temperature in the depths of the
sea, and his thermometer, placed in communication with the different
sheets of water, gave him the required degree immediately and

Oliver Queen saved the day once again — this time as mayor.

After a shooter targeted City Hall during Wednesday’s episode of Arrow, Oliver (Stephen Amell) needed to use his power as the mayor, not as the Green Arrow, to save his city. Oliver was successful in pleading with the shooter, who had taken his anger out on Star City’s government for failing to pass a gun safety law after his family was killed in a shooting. Ironic, yes, but will the shooter’s actions impact Oliver’s opinion on killing moving forward?

“One of the things you’ll see in the second half of season 5 is the gray area becomes a lot more gray,” executive producer Marc Guggenheim says. “We’re really delving into the complexities of Oliver being a killer in a way that we’ve never done on the show before.”

Whereas past seasons have been very black-and-white when it comes to Oliver’s decision to kill his enemies — it’s been his modus operandi to take no prisoners for most of the series — this season will explore the reasons why. “In many ways, Oliver killing is the seminal moral quandary of the show,” Guggenheim says. “One of the things we are doing in the back half of season 5 is really getting underneath that and what that means, not just in terms of morality, but in terms of psychology — specifically Oliver’s psychology. There’s things about Oliver’s killing that you have yet to learn.”

By hour’s end, Oliver enacted a gun safety law — the details of which aren’t expressly revealed — but don’t expect those new regulations to necessarily change Team Arrow’s operations moving forward. “Oliver’s decision to kill or not to kill has huge moral implications not just for him, but for the team and the people who work for him,” executive producer Wendy Mericle says. “But for the rest of the season, we’ll definitely be exploring the ramifications of that decision — not necessarily with regards to the gun control laws now that they exist, and what does that mean for the team when they’re out in the field, but definitely in respect to Felicity [Emily Bett Rickards] and to some extent Curtis [Echo Kellum] as well, with what they’re going through. How do they square their own circles morally with the actions that they’ve taken?”

Regardless of the new laws, Oliver & Co. will face opposition very soon. “In the very next episode, Team Arrow is going to come up against the police for a very different kind of reason,” Guggenheim teases. The logline for next week’s episode reveals that the SCPD targets the Green Arrow for the murder of Detective Malone, which should make things very interesting considering Dinah Drake (Juliana Harkavy) has just joined the police department.

“Dinah offers this fresh perspective to the team,” Guggenheim says. “In many ways, she’s kind of acting like our Greek chorus. She comes to the team without the burden of having been trained by Oliver and without the burden of dealing with all of Oliver’s secrets — and in some cases, in previous seasons, lies and mishegoss. So she just has a nice, clean perspective that isn’t so much about where she’s living as it is about what she’s been through and her backstory. But her backstory also is not being someone who was a member of Team Arrow, who comes to the team without the baggage of the past four seasons.”

Little does Oliver know, being targeted by the SCPD may be the least of his worries. After all, his girlfriend Susan (Carly Pope) not only uncovered Ollie’s connection to the Bratva but now suspects that Oliver could actually be the Green Arrow. What she’ll do with that information, however, remains to be seen. “It seems like the general prevailing theories about how we’re going to pay that subplot off are wrong,” Guggenheim says. “Everyone’s expecting something we’re not doing, for better or for worse.”

Oliver also has to contend with the growing threat that is Prometheus, with Arrow planning to explore more of the Big Bad in next week’s hour. “Episode 14 is this fulcrum where a lot of the little seeds that had been planted in the first half of the season start to come to fruition, and you start to realize that, ‘Oh, Prometheus has been setting up a chess board,'” Guggenheim says. “The episode ends with the next key move in Prometheus’ grand plan.”

As for when viewers will find out who’s actually under that mask, Guggenheim notes the reveal will come “later than we typically do,” though declined to be more specific about Prometheus’ identity. “Anytime we do a reveal on the show, it’s always with the intention of not just surprising the audience, but also of resetting the board and resetting the characters’ perspectives, and the characters having a profound reaction to things,” he continues. “Hopefully, we’ll do that again. … I feel good about what our game plan is.”

And that game plan has been in place since the start of the season — at least as it pertains to knowing Prometheus’ identity. “Yes, we knew from the beginning,” Guggenheim says. “No, it hasn’t changed. I think I’ve said this in a bunch of different ways over the last five years, but we always go in with a plan. We do tend to call audibles as we get inspired and get new ideas. A year is a long time. But generally speaking, something that major, like the mystery of the identity of the Big Bad, we’re pretty dialed into it from the jump.”

Despite whatever Prometheus has planned for Oliver, the producers seem relatively positive that, in his new position as mayor, Oliver may actually not fail this city. “Thea’s [Willa Holland] gonna make a good case to Oliver, of all people, for all the things he’s accomplished as mayor, and you start to see like, ‘Oh wait, in the first 13 episodes, he actually kind of did some stuff.’ And he’s not done yet. Obviously, the season’s not done yet, but we definitely went into the season with the goal of showing that Oliver is actually much better at this job than you might expect.”

Arrow airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW.
