You hear it, or see it if you're online, every time someone asks what they should do while visiting Dallas.  One of the quickest responses is always 'go check out the Dallas World Aquarium.

SALT LAKE CITY -- Notorious Mexican drug cartels have their tentacles in Utah, and the top drug enforcement agent in Utah calls it "the greatest threat to public safety. "

"The traffickers made no money in Utah last year, and this is about greed," said Frank Smith, DEA Assistant Special Agent in Charge of Utah.  "If we can stop them from making a profit, they're going to go away. "

But that won't happen right away, and the Smith warned Utahns to be cautious in the backcountry this spring and summer.  He said Mexican drug cartels are developing and hiding more large-scale marijuana grows on our state's public lands, especially in southern Utah.  Federal agents are waging a war against those cartels. 

Dateline NBC's Chris Hansen tackled the topic last night on the program.
